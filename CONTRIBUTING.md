## Getting Started

Before you start, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x installed
- A virtual environment set up for the project
- Forked the repository and cloned your fork to your local machine

To contribute, you'll need a basic understanding of Python and familiarity with libraries such as `matplotlib` for visualization and `flask` or `django` for web app creation, depending on the task you choose.

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions of any kind - from bug fixes to feature improvements, to documentation. To get started, take a look at the project's open issues or create new ones.

### Vocabulary Management

Help us develop the vocabulary management module, which includes functions to input, store, organize, and retrieve vocabulary words.

- Input/Store: Create functions to input new words along with translations, pronunciation, and usage examples.
- Organize: Write algorithms to categorize words by topic, difficulty, or part of speech.

### Vocabulary Quiz and Practice

Assist in developing the quiz and practice exercises module. This includes generating dynamic quizzes and providing immediate feedback.

- Quiz Generation: Implement functions to create quizzes based on stored vocabulary.
- Feedback System: Develop a system that provides immediate feedback to users' responses.

### Data Visualization and Progress Analysis

Contribute by creating visualizations of users' learning progress and a system to analyze their strengths and weaknesses.

- Visualization: Use data visualization libraries to create intuitive graphs and charts.
- Progress Analysis: Write algorithms to analyze user data and provide insights.
