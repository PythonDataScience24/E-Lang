# Welcome to the Language Learning Assistant Project!

## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in our project! We're developing a Language Learning Assistant that will help users to easily input, store, and review vocabulary words along with their translations. Our platform will include features like quizzes to reinforce learning and visualizations to track progress. This project is part of the evaluation for the Advanced Pzthon Course at the University of Berne.

# Getting Started

## How to Install Node.js using nvm

`nvm` is a version manager for Node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. Follow these steps to install `nvm`, and then use it to install Node.js and npm.

### Install nvm

#### Windows

1. **Download and Install nvm-windows:**
   - Go to the [nvm-windows release page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
   - Download the `nvm-setup.zip` file and extract it.
   - Run the `nvm-setup.exe` file and follow the prompts to install.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
   ```bash
   nvm --version (1.1.12)

## How to Install Node.js

Node.js is required to run the frontend part of the project. Follow these steps to install Node.js on your system.

### Windows

1. **Download the Node.js Installer:**
   - Go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the Windows Installer (the `.msi` file) for the LTS (Long Term Support) version.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the prompts in the installer. The default settings are fine for most users.
   - Ensure that the option to add Node.js to your PATH is checked.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   Open a command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   node --version == v22.1.0
   npm --version == 10.7.0

## Flask Backend SetUp

### Set Up & Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system. You can verify your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version

git clone https://github.com/PythonDataScience24/E-lang.git

cd E-lang/backend

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd WEB
```
### Run the App
```bash
python run.py

```
### Viewing the App
Go To ```http://127.0.0.1:5000``` on your browser to View the Backend


# React Frontend SetUp

Navigate to the FrontEnd Directory

``` bash
cd E-lang/elang

npm install

npm start

```
Go To ```http://127.0.0.1:3000``` on your browser to View the Frontend
