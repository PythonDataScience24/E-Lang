# Welcome to the Language Learning Assistant Project!

## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in our project! We're developing a Language Learning Assistant that will help users to easily input, store, and review vocabulary words along with their translations. Our platform will include features like quizzes to reinforce learning and visualizations to track progress. This project is part of the evaluation for the Advanced Pzthon Course at the University of Berne.
