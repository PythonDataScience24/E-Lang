# Language Learning Assistant Roadmap

## Welcome to the Language Learning Assistant Project!

### SUMMARY
Our goal is to develop a Language Learning Assistant to aid users in practicing and tracking their progress in a new language. The application will feature:

- **Vocabulary Management**: Users can input and store vocabulary, including translations, pronunciation, and usage examples. Words will be organized by topic, difficulty, or part of speech.
- **Vocabulary Quiz and Practice**: The system will generate quizzes and practice exercises based on the user's vocabulary set, provide immediate feedback, and track progress over time.
- **Data Visualization and Progress Analysis**: Visualizations will show users their learning progress, word count, quiz accuracy, and category-based advancements, allowing them to analyze strengths and weaknesses to tailor future study.

### How to get involved
- **TODO**: [Detailed steps for contributors to follow in order to get involved in the project.]

### Timeline
The project is segmented into milestones aligned with the last 6 weeks of the Data Science Course at Uni Berne:

- **Milestone 1: Project Initialization**
  - Choose a project and establish project management practices by April 25th, 2024.
  - Setup initial project repository on GitHub.

- **Milestone 2: Foundation Building**
  - Develop basic input and storage functionality for vocabulary by May 2nd, 2024.
  - Implement the first version of the category organization system.

- **Milestone 3: Interactivity**
  - Create the quiz generation logic and basic user interface for practice exercises by May 16th, 2024
  
- **Milestone 4: Testing and Feedback Integration**
  - Develop unit tests for each component of the application by May 23rd, 2024.
  - Address issues raised in initial user testing and feedback sessions.
  - Refine data visualization features and ensure accuracy of progress tracking.
  - Enhance user experience based on iterative testing and feedback.
  - Implement a system for tracking and visualizing long-term user progress.

- **Milestone 5: Finalization and Presentation**
  - Set up a virtual environment for the application by May 30th, 2024, to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.
  - Finalize all features and conduct comprehensive user acceptance testing.
  - Optimize performance and ensure that the application is scalable.
  - Prepare and perform an in-person presentation to demonstrate the application's capabilities, including the management of vocabulary, interactive quizzes, and progress tracking through visualizations.
  - Finalize documentation including code comments, usage guides, and a maintenance manual to facilitate future development and user support.
  - Officially release the application to the user community for use and further feedback.

### Final Notes
This roadmap serves as a living document and will evolve based on project needs and stakeholder feedback. Contributors are encouraged to keep up with the latest updates by checking our GitHub repository's issues and project boards.

We welcome all contributors and look forward to making language learning more accessible and efficient through our collaborative efforts. Let's build something great together!
